## Getting Started

Welcome to the VS Code Java world. Here is a guideline to help you get started to write Java code in Visual Studio Code.

## Folder Structure

The workspace contains two folders by default, where:

- `src`: the folder to maintain sources
- `lib`: the folder to maintain dependencies

Meanwhile, the compiled output files will be generated in the `bin` folder by default.

> If you want to customize the folder structure, open `.vscode/settings.json` and update the related settings there.

## Dependency Management

The `JAVA PROJECTS` view allows you to manage your dependencies. More details can be found [here](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode-java-dependency#manage-dependencies).


### How to run the program (on Windows)

1. You need to add the PostgreSQL JDBC driver to this Java project. 
    - Add the downloaded JAR file to the 'lib' folder in the Java Project in VS Code

2. This Java project connects to the Postgres database named 'postgresAS2', make sure to accomplish the connection so that you can run operations successfully.

3. Move to the 'DatabaseConnection.java' and run this file. 

4. All possible methods are mentioned in 'main' method. Choose methods you want to run, uncomment it/them, and run the program.
